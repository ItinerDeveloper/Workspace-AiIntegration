# AI Integration Service

## Service Route
`/aiintegration/aiintegration`

## Description
The AI Integration service allows users to call an MS Azure endpoint from the Itiner Workspace workflow using a prompt specified in the `aiPrompt` variable. It is triggered via a webhook set up within a workflow. The service then writes the response generated by the AI back into the workflow's `aiAnswer` variable. Users can also attach documents to the prompt, which the AI can summarize or analyze according to the prompt's requirements.

## Dedicated Template Variables
- **aiPrompt**: The variable containing the prompt to be sent to the MS Azure endpoint.
- **aiAnswer**: The variable where the response from the AI will be stored.
